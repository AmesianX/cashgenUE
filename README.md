Infinite Procedural World Generator for UE 4.10

You can see a video of it in action here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7PhpJCcipA&feature=youtu.be

This is a straight dump of the source folder from my private Perforce repo, it has not been prepared for release in *any* way and is riddled with known bugs and terrible code. I am liable to dump untested API breaking code into this repo at any time, please do not use it for anything important.

You'll need a LibNoise in your ThirdParty folder for the code to run. I'm working on integrating a UE-ified version of the library shortly.

Feel free to poke around though :)
